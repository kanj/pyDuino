pyDuino18  ver 1.0

Copyright 2012 by Kirk Terrell (knjterrell@mybluelight.com) under the MIT License
This work is based on Python Arduino Prototyping API, 


PyDuino helps you to quickly prototype Arduino programs, 
without having to repeatedly load the program to the Arduino board.

#### Setup:

1. Load prototype.pde onto your Arduino dev board.
2. Import the arduino lib in your python script.


## Methods

The methods reflect the same usage as the arduino language, thru release 18. An additional method pulseOut(pin, duration) is included. 
This was to address sending short pulses to a servo. Which could not be done due to the constrainst of serial communication. Two additional methods
exist in Arduino release 1.0 that are not in Arduino 18 aRef and shiftIn. These will be implemented in a future release.

### Functions

Additionally the functions for arduino have been included in the arduino lib. One exception is noted map in Arduino conflicts with map in python. 
It has been renamed aMap in this implementation. Certain additional functions exist in Arduino 1.0, and will be implemented in a future release

### Testing

The included sample programs were used to verify functionality of the software.

## Limitations

There a number of limitations:
    1)  Only implements Arduino Release 18
    2)  Responsiveness is limited by rate ofd serial communication
    3)  Unable to use analog pins digitally
